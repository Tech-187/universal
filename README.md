Hey @everyone

We're accurately rating and approving ROBLOX script executors in ⁠┊・working-executors by running all sorts of tests, as well as heavy scripts, old scripts, etc.

If you have or know any executors that we haven't given a rating yet (that still works) then let us know.

There is a lot of misinformation going out as well as a lot of misunderstandings in general with executors like people not knowing how good something is or executors faking their UNC score by adding placeholder UNC functions; etc, so I thought the best thing would be to give our general rating as I for instance have been accurately testing all sorts of executors for over 2 years and know what I should run to really put it to the test.

It's possible you might disagree with the grades as it's being rated in a large scale. If a dev is new and just made their first executor and it ends up quite bad, yeah that's most likely gonna get F- (the ratings are really really blunt but this is what the people actually want.)

Only SC Approved executors will get their downloads given out

Soon testing AppleWare!
